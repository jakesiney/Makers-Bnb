# Welcome to Makersbnb project! 

This collaborative effort involved a team of six developers who dedicated three days to create an impressive Airbnb clone.

In this project, we successfully built a fully functioning web application where users can either log in or create an account. Users have the flexibility to create their own listings or book existing ones. Our backend was crafted using Python, employing a test-driven approach. We utilised a variety of repository classes and embraced object-oriented programming principles to ensure a robust and efficient system.
